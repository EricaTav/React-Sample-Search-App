# React Search App - FinCompare




This React App is using [**React/Redux/SaSS/Webpack**](https://github.com/christinecha/react-redux-sass-boilerplate.git) boilerplatte.

Its a single page application using ReactJS with 2 views: one with a search field and the other that presents the search results.
The search uses [**Fincompare API**](http://app.fincompare.de/api/v1/company?q=test) to get companies data (name, id, register).

In order for this search to work it includes [**Cors-Anywhere**](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) to surpass CORS issues.

React Component sample tests are also present in this App, using Jest and Enzyme.
